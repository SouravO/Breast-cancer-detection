# üî¨ Breast Cancer Detection  
This project uses machine learning to classify whether a tumor is malignant or benign based on various features extracted from breast mass images. It employs classification algorithms to build a predictive model using the Breast Cancer Wisconsin dataset.

## üìå Features  
```markdown
* Loading and preprocessing of the Breast Cancer dataset  
* Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)  
* Feature scaling and selection  
* Training of classification models (e.g., Logistic Regression, SVM, Random Forest)  
* Performance evaluation using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall  
* Confusion matrix and ROC curve visualization
```
## üß∞ Requirements
```markdown
* Python 3.x
* Jupyter Notebook
* Libraries:
      pandas
      numpy
      matplotlib
      seaborn
      scikit-learn
```
## ‚öôÔ∏è Installation  
1) Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/breast-cancer-prediction.git
cd breast-cancer-prediction
```
2) Open the notebook:
```bash
jupyter notebook breast.ipynb
```
## üöÄ Usage
```markdown
* Run the cells sequentially in the Jupyter Notebook.  
* Analyze the visualizations from EDA.  
* Review model performance on the test set.  
* Use the model to classify new samples (if applicable).
```
## üß† Code Overview
```markdown
* Data Loading: Loads the Breast Cancer dataset from sklearn.datasets.  
* EDA: Includes visualizations of class distribution, feature correlation, etc.  
* Preprocessing: Scaling and splitting of data.  
* Modeling: Trains classification models (e.g., Logistic Regression, SVM).  
* Evaluation: Confusion matrix, accuracy, classification report, ROC curve.
